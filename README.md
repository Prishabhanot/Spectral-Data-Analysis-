**Spectral Data Analysis**
This model generates synthetic spectral data, smooths it using Gaussian distributions and Savitzky-Golay filters, and performs first and second derivative calculations to detect peaks. It visualizes the original and smoothed data for comparison. Commonly used in signal processing and spectral analysis for noise reduction and feature detection.

**Features**
Synthetic Spectral Data Generation: Creates noisy spectral data by summing random Gaussian curves.

Smoothing Techniques: Smooths spectral data using Gaussian distributions and Savitzky-Golay filters.

Derivative Calculations: Calculates first and second derivatives using finite difference methods.

Peak Detection: Identifies peaks in the smoothed spectrum based on derivative conditions.

Data Visualization: Plots original and smoothed data for visual comparison.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x

NumPy

Matplotlib
